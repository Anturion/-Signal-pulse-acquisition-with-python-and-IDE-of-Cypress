# -Signal-pulse-acquisition-with-python-and-IDE-of-Cypress
 You can acquire any signal with a sensor that handles serial port connection (Arduino, embedded Cypress)


Any sensor can be connected through a serial port, keep in mind that you must change the COM number in the interface.py file for the COM that you are going to connect to the serial port
You can create users and save the records of filtered signals through Wavelet windows which are designed in the file Pulso.py
